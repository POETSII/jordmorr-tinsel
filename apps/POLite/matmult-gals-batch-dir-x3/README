Rough copy of X3 (9x9 cube matrix per node)

Usage:

Two files needs altering to speciify your use case.

1. matmult.py
2. Run.cpp

# matmult.py

This file is designed to generate the matrices for you in step sizes of 3.
The only value that requires changing is run_max. This needs setting to your last valid mod 3 value (plus 1 for python syntax).
e.g. to run such that the last matrices calculated are 21 x 21, run_max = 22.

# Run.cpp

The cluter size needs specifiying in two places within this file.

HostLink *host_link = new HostLink(x, y)
PGraph <MatDevice, MatState, None, MatMessage>*graph = new PGraph<MatDevice, MatState, None, MatMessage>(x, y)

Where :-
x = cluster x dimension
y = cluster y dimension


RUNNNING THE SCRIPT =>

python matmult.py

This will report stdout/stderr and relevent processing times. The processing times will also be recorded in results.csv if run is successful.
