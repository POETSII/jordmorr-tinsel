Single thread Eigen implementation	
###########################################

REQUIREMENTS:
This implementation requires the Eigen C++ library.
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/

Usage:

This implementation is designed to run a singled threaded matrix multiplier on the X86 hosteling machine.
One file needs altering to specify your use case.

1. matmulteigen.py

# matmulteigen.py

This file is designed to generate the matrices for you in incremental step sizes.
The only values that require changing are those used in the matrix generation loop. 

step_size = xxxx
run_max = xxxx

for dimension in range(xxxx, run_max, step_size):


RUNNING THE SCRIPT =>

python matmulteigen.py

This will report the dimension and relevant processing times. The processing times will also be recorded in results.csv if run is successful.
