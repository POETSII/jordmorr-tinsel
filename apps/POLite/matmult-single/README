Single thread baseline implementation	
###########################################

Usage:

This implementation is designed to run a singled threaded matrix multiplier on the X86 hosteling machine.
One file needs altering to specify your use case.

1. matmult.py

# matmult.py

This file is designed to generate the matrices for you in incremental step sizes.
The only value that requires changing is run_max. This needs setting to your last valid value (plus 1 for python syntax).
e.g. to run such that the last matrices calculated are 10 x 10, run_max = 11.

Multiple runs of the same values may be performed by changing the following loop =>

for it in range(10)


RUNNING THE SCRIPT =>

python matmult.py

This will report stdout/stderr and relevant processing times. The processing times will also be recorded in results.csv if run is successful.
