Rough copy of X2 (2x2 cube matrix per node)

Usage:

Two files needs altering to specify your use case.

1. matmult.py
2. Run.cpp

# matmult.py

This file is designed to generate the matrices for you in step sizes of 2.
The only value that requires changing is run_max. This needs setting to your last valid mod 2 value (plus 1 for python syntax).
e.g. to run such that the last matrices calculated are 10 x 10, run_max = 11.

Multiple runs of the same values may be performed by increasing the following loop =>

for _ in range(10)

# Run.cpp

The cluster size needs specifying in two places within this file.

HostLink *host_link = new HostLink(x, y)
PGraph <MatDevice, MatState, None, MatMessage>*graph = new PGraph<MatDevice, MatState, None, MatMessage>(x, y)

Where :-
x = cluster x dimension
y = cluster y dimension


RUNNING THE SCRIPT =>

python matmult.py

This will report stdout/stderr and relevant processing times. The processing times will also be recorded in results.csv if run is successful.
